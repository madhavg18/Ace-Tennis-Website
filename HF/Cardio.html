	<p class="hf"> When played at a high level against an opponent with whom you are equally matched, tennis can give anyone an outstanding cardiovascular workout. However, if you are a beginner player or having trouble finding opponents that will make you run for an hour or more, you might not feel like you are getting much of a workout when you play. </p>
	<p class="hf">
	You need a set of cardio tennis drills, which are gaining in popularity as people seek varied forms of exercise and a new wave of athletes begins to take up tennis.
	</p>
	<p class="hf">
	Let’s face it—tennis can be very static if the rallies in which you engage do not last very long. You hit back and forth 3-5 times, then stop, then pick up a ball, then bounce to serve again, etc. There can be much more standing-around time than actual movement unless you are at a level where rallies last a bit longer.
	<p class="hf">
	That’s why many players are turning to cardio tennis drills to improve their fitness level and have more fun on the court as well.
	</p>
	<p class="hf">
	Here are a cardio tennis drills that have proven helpful to many. These drills have been screened and are actually taught to tennis coaches and teachers.
	</p>
	<p class="hf">
	Some of the drills call for foam or low compression balls, both of which are easily available at sporting goods stores. Such balls slow the game down a bit and ensure more control, thus boosting the chance of a prolonged drill. All of these drills are designed for just two players. Many more cardio tennis drills can be found online for groups or teams:

	<u>
	Cardio Tennis Drill #1: MINI TENNIS WITH BODY BUMP (5-10 minutes)
	</u>
	</div>
	<p class="hf">
	Using foam or low compression balls if available, players start on the service line across from their partners, who are at the service line on the other side of the court. They rally but first receive the ball by blocking it with their body. The ball must first bump off a body part (chest, head, knee, foot), then bounce to the ground, when it is then hit back over the net. This is an excellent warm-up exercise that creates more movement as the ball bounces off the body and a quick stroke must be taken. As players are forced to get their bodies in front of the ball, they move even more than usual.

	<div id="title">
	<u>
	Cardio Tennis Drill #2: MIRROR (5-10 minutes):
	</u>
	</div>
	<p class="hf">
	On opposite sides of the net, the players stand at the "T" on the service line. Holding their racquets in front of them in ready volley position, one player calls out where he will begin to run, calling out "up", for instance, as he runs toward the net. As that player advances, the player on the opposite side must act as a mirror for him. As the first player then calls out "left" and shuffles to his left, the mirror player moves to his right to act as a reflection of the first player. Each player takes about 60 seconds to direct the action while the other player serves as the mirror. After a few rounds of this warm-up, both players will definitely feel a burn and will be doing plenty of heavy breathing.
